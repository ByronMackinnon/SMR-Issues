# Basic Overview
[RL6Mans](https://www.rl6mans.com) is a discord server that allowed players within the top 10% of the player base to queue against one another in a competitive atmosphere that differs from ranked within [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/). I wanted to create a community that allowed the bottom 90% of players access to this format, and give them an opportunity to increase their communication skills and potentially find people to play with.

## My solution
This is a discord bot to implement the [RL6Mans](https://www.rl6mans.com) format to the rest of the Rocket League Community. Inclusive to all of the ranks below Diamond 1. (Lower ~90% of players.) All players will be able to play in this server.
